# Navigation Fix - Hash Links Issue Resolved ✅

## Problem
When users were on profile pages (like `/bab`) and clicked navigation links like "Features" or "How It Works", the links were adding hash fragments to the current URL (e.g., `/bab#features`) instead of navigating to the homepage with the correct section.

## Root Cause
The navigation links in the Navbar component were using regular `<a href="#features">` tags instead of Next.js `Link` components that would properly navigate to the homepage first.

## Solution
Updated all navigation links to use Next.js `Link` components with proper homepage URLs:

### Before:
```tsx
<li><a href="#features">Features</a></li>
<li><a href="#how-it-works">How It Works</a></li>
<li><a href="#pricing">Pricing</a></li>
```

### After:
```tsx
<li><Link href="/#features">Features</Link></li>
<li><Link href="/#how-it-works">How It Works</Link></li>
<li><Link href="/#pricing">Pricing</Link></li>
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/Navbar.tsx`
- Updated all navigation links to use `Link` components
- Changed `href="#section"` to `href="/#section"`
- Fixed linter errors by removing unused parameters

### 2. `src/app/page.tsx`
- Fixed footer link from `href="#how-it-works"` to `href="/#how-it-works"`

## Testing

### Before Fix:
- User on `/bab` clicks "Features" → URL becomes `/bab#features` ❌
- User on `/bab` clicks "How It Works" → URL becomes `/bab#how-it-works` ❌

### After Fix:
- User on `/bab` clicks "Features" → Navigates to `/#features` ✅
- User on `/bab` clicks "How It Works" → Navigates to `/#how-it-works` ✅
- User on `/bab` clicks "Pricing" → Navigates to `/#pricing` ✅
