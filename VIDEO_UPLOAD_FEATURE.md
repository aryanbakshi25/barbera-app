## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript

  type: 'image' | 'video';
  alt?: string;
  caption?: string;
  duration?: number; // For videos in seconds
}
```

### Database Storage
- Videos are stored in the same `images` JSONB column as images
- Each media item includes a `type` field to distinguish between images and videos
- Video duration is stored for display purposes

### File Validation
- **Duration Check**: Videos are validated to be under 10 minutes
- **Size Check**: Videos limited to 100MB, images to 10MB
- **Type Check**: Only image/* and video/* MIME types accepted

### Video Playback
- **Grid View**: Hover to play, pause on mouse leave
- **Modal View**: Full controls with play/pause/seek
- **Muted by Default**: Videos start muted for better UX

## Usage Instructions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Upload Failures**: Check file size and duration limits

4. **Storage Errors**: Monitor Supabase storage limits

### Debug Tips
- Check browser console for video-related errors
- Verify video file format and encoding
- Test with different video sizes and durations
- Monitor network requests for video uploads
- Check Supabase storage permissions

This implementation provides a robust video upload and playback experience while maintaining compatibility with existing image functionality.
